# MEDS-optimization

##MEDS optimiztion is the research project done for the purposes of the faculty course "Computal Inteligence". Idea of the project is research and implementation of the optimization algorithms for the MEDS (MINIMUM EDGE DOMINATING SET) problem which tries to find the minimal set of edges of the graph in the way so that all the edges are ether in the minimum set or are adjacent to the edges in the set.
